# Intro

I like making fursuits, it's my artistic output! I make fursuits for myself and others and occasionally sell partials.

# About me

I've been in the fandom since the mid 1990's, if you know me you know that I've been deeply involved in the fandom for a long time in various ways. 

I'm really particular about fursuits, I built my first fursuit around 2000, and since then I've been dabbling at it, building lots of suits, initially
starting with hand carved foam heads and not I'm 3D modeling and printing molds for my fursuits. 

I make suits for myself, and occasionally others - I'm really particular about what I want in a suit:

## About my suits

### They have to pop!

What's the point of a suit that doesn't come to life?

It should look good from all angles, it should feel like it's alive. I want suits that come to life soo much that it draws attention and causes people to pause when they look at it. 

I throw a lot of heads and fursuits away because they don't come to life - this is how important it is to me. I do this for my clients as well. 

I will throw away a head and restart, even reprint molds and go back to the drawing board if I think I could have done better. I've thrown away 3 full suits that I've made because they didn't come to life. I've thrown away countless heads, which while technically were excellent, didn't capture the feel I was after. 

It can be as small as a mouth line, or how the colors on the head contour the muzzle - I'm really particular. 

I will remake molds and redesign heads until I get what I want. 

This is why I don't strive for volume of suits, this is why I'm selective about commission. 

I'd rather be known for just a few amazing suits, rather then lots of mediocre suits. 

### It has to be comfortable to wear for many hours at a time:

What's the point of an uncomforable suit? 

If it isn't comfortable to wear then it never gets seen, then it never has the impact it could have had if it was more comfortable. 

* It has to breath well.
* It has to feel good to wear.
* It has to have excellent vision. 
* It has to be easy to put on.
* Fabrics and technical designs account for temperature management. 

###  It has to feel amazing

I'm really particular about the feel of the fabrics I choose, I want things that feel good to the touch. 

I want suits that when people touch them they are surprised at the feel of the fur and other textures I've choosen. I'm very particular over the texture of the fabrics I'm choosing. I won't built a suit out of fur that doesn't feel good and won't be durable, even it meets the other design goals of the suit. 

### Why don't you take commissions?

I do, I'm just very very selective. 

I want to build things that I feel confident I can deliever amazing results on. 

I'd rather produce a few amazing suits, then lots of mediocre suits.

I am doing as primarly as an artistic output, secondairly as a business. 

My current model is to produce a few head molds that I'm very happy with and make a variety of suits using those head shapes. 

I spend a lot of time making sure that my fursuit heads, which are the primary reason a suit comes to life, are the best thing I can achieve.

I frequently do multiple version of the same mold, I need to see it come to life in 3D, and then conseqeutively in person once the head has been built.

### Build quality and durability is important but it can't be the only thing

Why strive for excellent build quality if you can't achieve a suit that comes to life? 

I prioritize "pop" over quality, because if I can't get something to pop, then why push so hard on quality? 

I'm not a seamstress - I'm a fursuit artist. 

That doesn't mean I discard quality, it means that it's secondary to artistry, it's a pillar that supports the end result, not the end result. 

I feel I've achieved a quality that is on-par with top tier fursuit makers, but certainly not the best quality that can be bought. 

Who cares if you have the most technically brilliant fursuit if it falls flat? That is not what I want!

Who cares if you've spent endless money on sewing machines to get perfectly amazing seams, if they don't support artistry in achieving it's goal, then ultimately as far as I'm concerned it's a failure.

### Why don't you make cartoon eye suits, etc?

It's just not my jam. 

I prefer the look of 3D eye suits, and I'm really particular, I want suits that feel like they are looking at you and have a kind of feral-ish feel. This is also why my designs don't use 
commont foot or hand paw patterns, I feel they don't achieve the results I'm after. 

There are lots of cartoony fursuit makers, they are awesome and amazing, but it's not what I'm chasing. 

I am doing as primarly as an artistic output, secondairly as a business.
